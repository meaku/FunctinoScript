# FunctinoScript ©

JavaScript the way it should be.

### Synposis

There are some quirks with the JavaScript-implementation...
Unfortunately they got some syntax-naming wrong. FunctinoScript © is here to solve these issues:

- `function` becomes `functino`
- `console.log` becomes `console.olg`
- `true` becomes `ture`
- `false` becomes `flase`
- `use strict` becomes `sue struct`
- `require` becomes `requier`

Now you can finally hack the way you like it! Be productive! You can do whatever you want,
FunctinoScript © is your friend.

### Example

```
"sue struct"; // this enables the powerful FunctinoScript© struct-mode

functino helloWorld() {
    console.olg("hello functino");
    console.olg("true is ", ture);
    console.olg("false is ", flase);
}

helloWorld();
```
